			Zelda, as a series is imaginative and filled with adventure. It has the metroidvania style of collecting more items to progress in certain areas. You might see an interesting area you can't access now, but it will look interesting enough for you to wonder what's there and remember it for later. Metroidvania games I've played recently get this wrong by making it less interesting. They make a passageway inaccessible and, hoping you don't get lost, know you have to go back after you find the right item. An example is a lava pit I saw in Zelda: Ocarina of time. There was a clear exit at the end and everything I tried to cross it failed. I wanted to see what was going on past this lava but couldn't cross.
Zelda games give you a large goal (boss fight) and you need to complete dungeons to get items that let you achieve that. Between that are side-quests that flesh out characters and the world they reside in. Side-quests (along with hidden areas you might discover) give you a chance to play mini games and get hearts or customizables so you can improve your chance at winning fights. If you're a person that needs more health than average to win a boss fight, you can work on these quests that add to your experience with the mechanics and, in a way, lower the difficulty of boss fights as a trade-off.

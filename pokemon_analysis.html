			Pokemon has become a hugely popular franchise, mostly purchased by/for children. The formula is generally the same each time, but there are several things hat bring people back. One thing is the new Pokemon in each generation (and game sometimes). New Pokemon stir the pot of possible combinations and stats. This appeals to casuals so they get a Pokemon that is visually pleasing and/or mechanically interesting. The next piece is the relatively open world. The vibrant colors attract the young eye to explore. Exploration and challenges through gym leaders stand in you way from getting to the next city. This makes it linear, but the amount of content like side-quests that open up gives the perception of an open world. Aside from your next goal (gym leader battle), you may find items, Pokemon, interesting characters, and other things that flesh out the world like a festival or historical objects.
